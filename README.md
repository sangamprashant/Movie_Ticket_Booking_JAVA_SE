# Movie Ticket Booking System

## Abstract
This project is an online movie ticket reservation system. Users can log in with their username and password, select a movie, choose a theater, pick show timings, and specify the number of tickets they want. The system displays the procedure details and generates a printable form to present at the respective ticket counter for ticket collection.

## Introduction
